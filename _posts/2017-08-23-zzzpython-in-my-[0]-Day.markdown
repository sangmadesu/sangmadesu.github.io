Voillaaaa... it's like i have the power of eating, programming, sysadmin and devops in one heart. :D

The purpose of this blog is to share about my knowledge and want to feel how difficult to keep consistency in technology. So, do not dissapointed when your read this blog is only contains to the basic about of the technology wkwkwk.

Finally, i would like to say thanks to my God Allah Subhanahu Wa ta'ala who has given life to this day and my Prophet Muhammad Shallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam who has taught all the good examples to life in this live. And for my family, you are the best family in this world.
